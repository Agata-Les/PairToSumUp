# Find pair of numbers that make a sum

You are given a vector containing at least two elements and filled with integers, both positive and negative, sorted in increasing order. You are given also a sum - an integer number positive or negative. You need to find in given container a pair of numbers that added up make the given sum. Do not exceed the computational complexity `O(n)`.

## Compile with

* g++
* -std=c++14
* -lgtest

## Running tests

```
g++ -std=c++14 main_test.cpp -lgtest
